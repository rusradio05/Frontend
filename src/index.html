    <p>To leon werth</p>
    <p>
      I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating
      it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in
      the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
      even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where
      he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not
      enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up
      grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it.
      And so I correct my dedication:

    <h2>I</h2>
    <p>
      Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
      called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
      picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
      copy of the drawing.
    </p>
    <img src="/src/img/hroznys.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
      chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through
      the six months that they need for digestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
      work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My
      Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    </p>
    <img src="/src/img/klobouk.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
      drawing frightened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
      constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able
      to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa
      constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need
      to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
    </p>
    <img src="/src/img/slon.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
      drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and
      devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That
      is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent
      career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing
      Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything
      by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever
      explaining things to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have
      flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography
      has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
      Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great
      many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have
      lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at
      hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried
      the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always
      kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
      understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
    </p>
    <p>"That is a hat."</p>
    <p>
      Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval
      forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to
      him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up
      would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
